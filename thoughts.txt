This is my thoughts for my project, anything that I want to do or thoughts, I add it here to remind me
.......................................................................................................


.time to make the final product for now

.also add a monologue for why you used axaj and not postreSQL
.finished

.why does the log in page redirect to the '/' page and not the bookReview page
.finished

..when i then go to the bookReview page, im logged out
.finished

.fix the footer, projects dropdownList of the small pages, in weatherApp and bookReview
.finished

.go through the css and js, and group up the classes that match and go through the other code to make
 cleaner code.
.finished

.have the todolist, be auto divided, if one or if two (rows)
.finished

.find out how to maybe add the weather app to the user, so you can manipulate the session info
 to remove whatever the previous person has entered, sometimes it still persists
 ...finished...

.add a session to everything to it is deleted...find out if it persists even if the user closes the page,
 and is not logged in
 ...finished...

.check the server data for the weatherApp, and send everything,
 filter them by the ui.js and chart instead
 .finished

.fix the results send from the weatherApp, 
..if you want to, make the weather app a graph
.finished

.make database_random a randomly generated password
.finished

.add the days to the beginning of the times in the charts
finished

..also implement auto email resets, or changes
finished (return maybe when i know more, but now my code don't work anymore-corrected)

.maybe later find out a way to make sure if the user has multiple google accounts linked, that it works,
 because now, it doesnt

..add error: SSL/TLS required on the databases linked to the on render
finished

.add all the projects to the database, so that it is not stored on the browser,
 because todoList is global (everyone's data is saved) and weatherApp is not opening, 
 maybe if in a database.
 finished

..everytime the user searches (weatherApp), increment the totalNum (db), and if it is 10, redirect to '/'
  finished

..(the browser is not picking up if it is one or mutiple users, so add them all to the db for session
  or find a way for the session to work even if they aren't logged in, so the borwser can save their info
  to determine if they are a user, safely)
  finished (but check when deployed)
  
..make an if/for statement, that handles that, and every 24 hours, reset the totalNum (db)
  waiting for deployment

...add the todoList to the session data, so it is not global
   waiting for deployment

....check why the google login system ('google Strategy' only) is not working correctly, if not, remove it
    

.....add an alert that says that the weatherApp and bookReview is only available after logging in,
     customize the alert, 
     finished

......also the delete alert of bookReview, find out about the rain.
